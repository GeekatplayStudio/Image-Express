## 🚀 Deployment

### Quick Start (Local)

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open the app**:
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or port 3001 if 3000 is busy).

### Desktop App (macOS & Windows)

Run Image Express as a standalone desktop application without manual login on localhost.

1. **Install dependencies** (once):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Desktop development mode** (hot reload for both Next.js and Electron):
   ```bash
   npm run desktop:dev
   ```
3. **Desktop production preview** (build + serve the desktop shell):
   ```bash
   npm run desktop:start
   ```
   This command runs `next build`, boots the standalone Next.js server on port 3927, and launches Electron.
4. **Create installers** (macOS DMG, Windows NSIS, Linux AppImage):
   ```bash
   npm run desktop:build
   ```

Inside the packaged app the Settings modal exposes “Desktop Updates” so users can manually check for new releases. Automatic checks run shortly after startup and every six hours; when an update finishes downloading the modal offers a restart button to install it.

### Docker Deployment

This project includes a `Dockerfile` optimized for production.

1. **Build**: 
   ```bash
   docker build -t image-express .
   ```
2. **Run**: 
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 image-express
   ```
