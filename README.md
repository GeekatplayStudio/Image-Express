## 🚀 Key Features

### Studio & Design
- **Modern Dashboard**: Redesigned home screen with quick-start templates (Instagram, YouTube, A4), recent designs grid, and community support links.
- **Infinite Canvas**: Advanced vector workspace using Fabric.js.
- **Layer Management**: Professional layer locking, visibility, reordering, multi-select, and folder organization (including empty folders and drag/drop).
- **Paint Folders**: Each paint session is grouped into a single folder; switching tools starts a new paint folder automatically.
- **Advanced Masking**: Non-destructive masking functionality. Select two objects to mask the bottom one with the top one; includes support for inverting masks.
- **Interactive Tools**: Gradient editor, shape tools, and text manipulation.
- **Export Options**: Export designs to PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF, JSON, and self-contained HTML bundles with all assets rewritten for offline playback.
- **In-App Manual**: Contextual help modal with persistent chapter navigation and quick close actions.

### AI Capabilities
- **Advanced 3D Generation**: 
  - Integrated **Meshy** and **Tripo** AI for high-quality 3D models.
  - **Textured Models**: Enforced PBR texture generation for realistic results.
  - **Background Processing**: Robust polling system for long-running AI tasks.
- **Image Generation**: (Coming Soon) Text-to-Image support.

### Storage & Management
- **Server-Side Design Storage**: Designs are saved securely on the server (via filesystem in this edition), bypassing browser storage limits.
- **Asset Library**: 
  - Upload, organize, and manage images and 3D models.
  - **3D Previews**: Hover over any 3D model asset to see a real-time rotating 3D preview popup.
  - **Renaming System**: Interactive renaming overlay for assets.
- **Authentication**: Secure login system with server-side key persistence for API access.
- **Session Security**: Automatic 30-minute inactivity timeout for guest and web users to protect sessions.
- **Audit Logging**: Automatic login activity logging with IP and user agent; viewable from Settings.
- **Desktop Shell**: Single-codebase Electron build with auto-update checks and in-app update prompts.
- **Optional Drive Backup**: One-click Google Drive integration to mirror saved designs into your personal Drive folder.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Quick Start (Local)

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open the app**:
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or port 3001 if 3000 is busy).

### Desktop App (macOS & Windows)

Run Image Express as a standalone desktop application without manual login on localhost.

1. **Install dependencies** (once):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Desktop development mode** (hot reload for both Next.js and Electron):
   ```bash
   npm run desktop:dev
   ```
3. **Desktop production preview** (build + serve the desktop shell):
   ```bash
   npm run desktop:start
   ```
   This command runs `next build`, boots the standalone Next.js server on port 3927, and launches Electron.
4. **Create installers** (macOS DMG, Windows NSIS, Linux AppImage):
   ```bash
   npm run desktop:build
   ```

Inside the packaged app the Settings modal exposes “Desktop Updates” so users can manually check for new releases. Automatic checks run shortly after startup and every six hours; when an update finishes downloading the modal offers a restart button to install it.

### Optional: Google Drive Backups

Keep a personal copy of every saved design in your Google Drive without exposing your credentials to the server.

1. Create an OAuth **Web application** in Google Cloud Console and note the **Client ID**.
2. Add the authorized JavaScript origins that match your dev/prod domains (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
3. Either set the environment variable before starting the app _or_ paste the Client ID directly into the Settings modal:
   ```bash
   export NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
   ```
   Creating a `.env.local` works too; if omitted, you can paste the ID into **Settings → Google Drive Backup** and it will be stored locally.
4. Run the app and open **Settings → Google Drive Backup → Connect** to approve access.
5. After connecting, every successful save keeps the local copy and uploads a JSON snapshot (with thumbnail metadata) to the `Image Express Backups` folder in your Drive.

### Docker Deployment

This project includes a `Dockerfile` optimized for production.

1. **Build**: 
   ```bash
   docker build -t image-express .
   ```
2. **Run**: 
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 image-express
   ```
